            <div class="accord-header">What is Remy human hair? <span class="icon-plus"></span></div>
            <div class="accord-content">
              <div class="accord-p">Remy human hair is the highest grade of real, human hair, which is a preferred choice for hair extensions, hairpieces, and wigs because it achieves the most natural look and can be styled and washed just like your own hair.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Remy hair is considered to be the finest quality of human hair because the cuticles are kept intact and not stripped, like in most non-Remy varieties. Preserving the hairs’ cuticles and aligning them in a unidirectional fashion creates extensions that are completely natural in appearance. This process ensures that the hair remains soft, shiny, silky and tangle-free throughout its lifetime.</div>
              <div class="accord-p"><a href="">Clip-in Luxy Hair extensions</a> use only the finest quality of Remy human hair, which means that the hair has been carefully sorted after collecting from the hair donor to ensure all the cuticles are intact. It is by far the best quality of clip in human hair extensions on the market because of the care that is required and the time it takes to sort the hair so meticulously. <a href="">Click here </a>to see how and where our products are made.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">What is the difference between synthetic and human hair extensions?</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Hair extensions made from human hair can be dyed a darker color, styled with hot tools (curled or straightened), washed frequently, and treated just like you would your own natural hair.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">On the other hand, hair extensions made from synthetic hair are sensitive to the sun, are difficult to style and blend with your own hair, and typically don't have the same lifespan as human hair extensions do. Human hair extensions can last up to a year or longer if they are properly cared for.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="accord-header">Can I color, tone, or bleach my hair extensions? <span class="icon-plus"></span></div>
            <div class="accord-content">
              <div class="accord-p">So, you have a beautiful and unique hair color that doesn't quite match any of the shades we offer. No stress! Luxy Hair extensions are made of 100% remy human hair and can, therefore, be dyed a darker color or toned by a professional hair colorist.</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                So what does remy human hair mean?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Remy hair is considered to be the finest quality of human hair because the cuticles are kept intact and not stripped, like in most other non-remy hair extensions. Preserving the hairs’ cuticles and aligning them in a unidirectional fashion creates extensions that are completely natural in appearance.

                What's the best way to color my extensions?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Being super careful with how your hair extensions are dyed is very important to ensuring the quality of your set is preserved. Naturally, dyeing or toning hair extensions can alter the quality of the set slightly, however, we'll provide you with the most important do's and don't's of dyeing your extensions to ensure your set lives a long and healthy life.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Kindly note, since our <a href="">Seamless extensions</a> are made with silicone at the base to ensure that they are thin and flat, this material does not take to dye. If you dye your Seamless extensions, the silicone strip will remain its original color after dyeing. Alternatively, our <a href="">Classic extensions</a> have a fabric base which can be dyed as it will take to the color.</div>
              <div class="accord-h2">Do's</div>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Always do a test strand prior to dyeing the full set</span></br>To do this, mix some of the color and apply it to a small section on one of the one-clip wefts. This will ensure you're satisfied with the results before moving on to the full set. If you don't like the result, you can then make adjustments to the formula or processing time and test it again. </li>
                <li><span>Always have a professional hair colorist work on your extensions</span></br>Ideally, have someone who has had previous experience working with clip-in hair extensions to ensure the color goes as intended. We always recommend using professional-quality brands for the best results.</li>
                <li><span>Pre-wash with sulfate & alcohol-free shampoo before coloring</span></br>Luxy Hair extensions come pre-conditioned and this silky coating needs to be removed in order for the color to absorb evenly. Plug your sink and fill it up with lukewarm water. Then, add 2-3 dollops of shampoo into the water, and swish the product around in the water so it's nice and soapy. We recommend washing your hair extensions one weft at a time (1-clip wefts can be collected into one bundle). Hold the weft with one hand at the top, submerge it into the water, and gently wash the hair. Avoid rubbing and be very careful to not tangle the hair. Once you are done, air-dry your Luxies and then you are ready for the color application!</li>
                <li><span>Opt for a lighter set of extensions to dye darker</span></br>Instead of getting a dark set of extensions to lift/highlight to a lighter shade, we recommend that you select a lighter shade of extensions and deposit a darker dye. Similarly, if you have highlights, we recommend going for a shade that matches the lightest highlight in your hair and having a professional hair colorist add in lowlights to your set.</li>
                <li><span>Always use a semi or demi-permanent color and a low volume developer</span></br>These dyes are the least invasive and will achieve the same color effect without damaging your extensions. We recommend using a 10 volume developer as it will only deposit color and not lift the hair which can change its integrity.</li>
                <li><span>Always apply the color to both sides of the weft and in one direction</span></br>Doing this will ensure thorough saturation and that the result is even and not patchy. Remember, it's always better to use more color than far too little. When applying the color, only apply it in a downwards direction. Start from the base of the weft moving downwards towards the ends, following the natural fall of the hair. Applying the color upwards can damage your extensions, and will likely leave them frizzy and tangled.</li>
                <li><span>Maintain a moisturizing care schedule</span></br>It's always important to keep the hair moisturized, however, color-treated hair will need extra care. We recommend doing a <a href=""> sulfate-free </a>deep conditioning treatment on the extensions after dyeing to ensure that any lost moisture and nourishment is added back into the hair. If possible, leave this on overnight for the best results. We also recommend deep conditioning your Luxies bi-weekly (or as needed) and using products that are specifically formulated for dry and damaged hair, as they will help keep the strands healthy and nourished. Also, look for products that add moisture to the hair like argan oil, coconut oil, castor oil and so on.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="accord-h2">Don't's</div>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Dye the entire set altogether</span><br>This can cause tangling and it also means that you have less control over the dye deposit. Dye one weft at a time so you have complete control over the outcome. </li>
                <li><span>Use any bleach (this includes highlights)</span><br>We do not recommend bleaching your Luxies as they have already been dyed at our manufacture, and forcing bleach on hair that has already been dyed can be difficult. Bleaching is a damaging process that will alter the quality and integrity of your set. Increasing the concentration of bleach or leaving it in longer to soak will only lead to damaged hair. </li>
                <li><span>Use products that contain sulfates or alcohol</span><br>These ingredients strip the hair of its natural oils and will affect their integrity. This, in turn, makes the hair drier and more prone to tangling or matting. Another downside is that these products will fade your hair color quicker. Always be sure to check the ingredient listing on the back of the product to ensure you don’t see the words: SLS, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Alcohol denat, Ethanol, SD alcohol 40, Propanol, Isopropyl, and Propyl.</li>
                <li><span>Try to dye them yourself at home or use over-the-counter dyes/toners</span><br>Taking the extra step to have a professional work on your extensions will be a worthwhile investment. A boxed hair dye from a drugstore won't give you the option to choose the developer and that is exactly what you don't want. The ratio of peroxide to pigment requires a specific balance. Doing this incorrectly can very easily leave hair dry and damaged if not done correctly.</li>
                <li><span>Over-wash them</span><br>We don't advice washing colored extensions often as this can strip the hair of its oils and will actually cause the hair color to fade faster. Keep in mind, lighter pastel colors will typically wash out a lot easier than a darker auburn shade.</li>
                <li><span>Apply purple shampoo directly to the hair</span><br>This can create patchiness and tangling and because certain areas of hair will soak up more of the shampoo which will cause staining and patchiness. We always recommend having a professional hairstylist tone your Luxies with a professional toner to prevent any unwanted results. If you wanted to do it yourself with purple shampoo, we recommend testing a one-clip weft to see how ashy the result will be. Keep in mind purple shampoo won't give you a dramatic ashy color like a toner will if you are toning our Dirty Blonde shade for example. First, dilute the shampoo in a bowl of warm water and run each weft through one by one.</li>

            <div class="accord-header">Can I use heat styling tools on my hair extensions? <span class="icon-plus"></span></div>
            <div class="accord-content">
              <div class="accord-p">Just like your own hair, Luxy Hair extensions can be straightened, blow-dried, styled and curled.</div>
              <div class="accord-h">HEAT STYLING TIPS</div>
              <div class="accord-p">In order to preserve and extend the lifespan of your Luxy Hair extensions, we suggest to always use a heat protectant spray prior to styling your set. Additionally, we recommend to only use a low heat setting of 120C/250F, as anything higher runs the risk of damaging the hair.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">The reason why we recommend opting for a lower heat setting is that it will prolong the lifespan of your set. While our own hair may be able to handle a high heat setting, our hair is also constantly getting revitalized from the scalp, whereas hair extensions don't get that sort of nutrition. We don’t recommend blow-drying your extensions after every wash as doing this constantly will make them dry and more vulnerable to breakage.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">If you need to use your extensions immediately after washing them, the most important thing is to ensure that you are blow drying on a cool setting to prevent any heat damage and that you don’t brush the hair until it is 90% dry. This is because the hair is at its weakest point when it's wet. Instead, use your fingers to gently loosen any tangles. When blow-drying, start by focusing on drying the root of the weft first and then working your way down to the ends. Always blow-dry downwards as this will help to not only smooth the cuticle but it will also prevent the hair from getting tangled since it is being blown in lots of different directions.</div>
              <div class="accord-h">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF AIR DRYING VS. HEAT STYLING?</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Preventing damage and keeping your extensions healthier for longer is the main advantage to air drying your extensions, however, there are several other benefits. If you want to embrace your hair’s natural texture for instance, air drying your extensions will help them blend more seamlessly into your own hair. If you’re in a hurry, you can just have your hair extensions ready to go by letting them air dry overnight (in a braid, for instance), and when you wake up and clip in your set you have gorgeous, beachy waves ready to go. Plus, you can also experiment with different curl patterns without having to buy an array of curling wands.</div>

            <div class="accord-header">How do I choose the right shade of Luxy Hair extensions? <span class="icon-plus"></span></div>
            <div class="accord-content">
              <div class="accord-p">Luxy Hair extensions are offered in 20 beautiful shades ranging from Jet Black to Platinum Blonde, and from Ombre to Balayage. Our extensions are made with a multi-tonal adapt coloring system, which means that there are subtle highlights and lowlights, lighter strands and darker strands throughout each set. This gives the shades movement, dimension, and depth. It also ensures that the extensions blend with your natural hair even if your hair color is a few shades off.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">To choose your perfect Luxy shade, please check out this <a href=""> support article</a> which explains the differences between each color.</div>

            <div class="accord-header">How do I wash my hair extensions? <span class="icon-plus"></span></div>
            <div class="accord-content">
              <div class="accord-p">Luxy Hair extensions are made with 100% remy human hair, which means they can be washed and styled just like your own natural hair. Since Luxy Hair extensions do not receive natural oils from the scalp like natural hair does, however, they do not need to be washed as often, as they will not get oily or greasy like natural hair.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">We recommend to only wash your Luxies every 15-20 wears or only when there is a lot of product build-up to the point where they become unmanageable to style. Watch the video below for full instructions on how to wash to properly wash your Luxies, or scroll down for step by step instructions.</div>

              <div class="accord-h3">YOU WILL NEED...</div>
              <div class="accord-p">1. A sink which can be plugged</div>
              <div class="accord-p">2. Alcohol / sulfate-free shampoo</div>
              <div class="accord-p">3. Alcohol / sulfate-free deep conditioner</div>
              <div class="accord-p">4. A wide tooth comb</div>
              <div class="accord-p">5. Hair oil</div>
              <div class="accord-h3">WHY ALCOHOL / SULFATE-FREE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER?</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Some hair products are loaded with alcohols and sulfates, which are extremely drying on the hair. Since hair extensions do not receive natural oils from the scalp, they are already dry by nature, and it is best to preserve moisture in the hair as much as possible. This will ensure that the extensions look healthy and luscious, as opposed to dry and dull. You can also use a shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for coloured treated hair or for hair extensions.</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 1: Brush your extensions
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Have you ever taken a shower, emerged with wet, tangled hair and have to wrestle to detangle it? Brushing your hair before showering will prevent this, and hair extensions are no different. Before washing your extensions, give them a good brush with a wide tooth comb or paddle brush from bottom to top, gently removing any knots and tangles in the hair. Then, place each weft neatly on top of each other similar to when you first receive them, to keep them tangle free during the washing process..</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 2: Prepare your sink
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Ensure your sink is squeaky clean to avoid existing dirt transferring to the extensions. Then, plug the drain and begin to fill it up with lukewarm water – we don’t want the water to be too hot or too cold.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Pump 2-3 dollops of shampoo into the water, and swish the product around in the water so it's nice and soapy.</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 3: Shampoo each weft
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">We recommend to wash your hair extensions one weft at a time (1-clip wefts can be collected into one bundle). This will ensure that each weft gets washed thoroughly without the set tangling. If you are short on time, however, you can bundle the extensions with an elastic and wash it all carefully in one go.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Hold the weft is one hand at the top, submerge it into the water, and gently wash the hair, working the shampoo in with light strokes. Be very careful to not tangle the hair. Once you have washed the weft with shampoo, set it aside neatly on a towel and repeat the same steps for the rest of the wefts.</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 4: Deep condition each weft
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Once all the wefts have been shampooed, it's time to condition them. This is a very important step, as it helps ensure that your extensions remain moisturized, nourished, and soft. We recommend to use a deep conditioner for this step, to really penetrate the hair shaft.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Take a generous amount of conditioner and apply onto each weft from top to bottom, massaging the product thoroughly into the hair.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">In order for the product to really soak in and work its magic, we recommend to leave it on overnight. Bundle your extensions and carefully coil them and place them in a shower cap to leave overnight. This will help to seal in the moisture throughout the night.</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 5: Rinse out each weft
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">The next morning, thoroughly rinse out each weft, ensuring that there is no conditioner residue left on the hair. A common mistake is to only wash the hair halfway, leaving it with "the slip"–that slippery, soft feeling after conditioning. This is a no-no, as it actually leaves product on the hair, which weighs it down or causes it to look greasy when dry.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">When washing out each weft, rinse it again with cold water, which will help close the cuticles of the hair to seal in the moisture and make the extensions more shiny. This is a great trick to try with your natural hair as well for that extra gloss and shine!</div>
              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 6: Lay each weft out to air dry
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">We recommend to air dry your hair extensions rather than use heat, as the hair does not get revitalized at the scalp, and using high heat can harm the extensions in the long run.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">Before setting up your extensions to dry, be sure that the hair is completely wrung of water. Then, lay out all of your wefts separately on a towel on top of a flat surface. A trick to preventing any frizz once the hair is dry is to apply a small amount of hair oil to each weft to ensure the hair remains manageable and silky smooth.</div>

              <div class="accord-h1">
                Step 7: Comb each weft
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">We usually recommend not to comb through wet hair as it is more elastic and can break easily, however, in order to ensure that your extensions dry straight with little to no tangles, we recommend to gently brush through each weft with a wide tooth comb from bottom to top.</div>
              <div class="accord-p">And that’s it! Leave the wefts to dry, and come back to clean smooth, hair extensions, ready to clip into your hair.</div>

                FAQ About Washing Hair Extensions
              </div>
              <div class="accord-h3">
                DO I NEED TO WASH MY LUXY HAIR EXTENSIONS BEFORE I WEAR THEM?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">No, Luxy Hair extensions are ready to wear straight out of the box! Hair extensions are a hygienic product and have been thoroughly sanitized at our factory. They are completely safe to wear right out of the box.</div>
              <div class="accord-h3">
                WHAT PRODUCTS SHOULD I USE ON MY LUXY HAIR EXTENSIONS?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">We highly recommend to use natural, and organic hair products if possible. Make sure the hair products are sulfate free, alcohol free, and are designed for color treated hair or hair extensions. This will ensure that your hair extensions have a longer lifespan.</div>
              <div class="accord-h3">
                DO I NEED TO WASH MY HAIR EXTENSIONS AFTER CURLING TO MAKE THEM STRAIGHT AGAIN?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Unless the hair has a lot of hairspray or other product buildup, this is not needed. Instead, you can gently brush out the curls with a soft bristle brush from bottom to top, and use a hair straightener to straighten the extensions. Be sure to use a heat protectant spray prior to straightening, and to use a low to medium heat setting.</div>
              <div class="accord-h3">
                DO THESE HAIR EXTENSIONS DRY STRAIGHT?
              </div>
              <div class="accord-p">Luxy Hair extensions are of Chinese origin, therefore, should dry straight. Be sure to brush the extensions straight before air-drying overnight. Some sets could be potentially dry with a slight wave, however, can be styled with hot styling tools to achieve any desired look.</div>
              <div class="accord-h">WHY AREN’T YOU WASHING THE ACTUAL CLIPS/WEFTS IN THIS VIDEO?</div>
              <div class="accord-p">The fabric base of the weft does not need to be washed, however, if you use a lot of product and feel that the fabric and clips also need to be washed, you can do so.</div>
